# Terms of Use (EULA)

**Last updated:** 23 November 2025

These Terms of Use (“Terms”) govern your use of the application (“the App”), developed and provided by an individual developer (“the Developer”, “we”, “our”, or “us”). By using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 1. Purpose of the App

The App is a free utility that allows you to:

- Add products, warranties, invoices, insurances, and other documents.
- Track expiration dates and see time remaining.
- Receive optional notifications before expiration.
- Store documents locally on your device or via iCloud/CloudKit.
- View and download your documents.
- See statistics such as spending amounts. The "average per month" shown is a median value for the whole year.

The App is provided solely for personal organization. It is not intended to replace official storage, legal documentation systems, or certified reminders.

## 2. No Account Required

The App does not require or provide user accounts. All data is stored locally on your device and/or in your private iCloud storage, depending on your preferences.

## 3. No Guarantee of Data Storage or Availability

While the App uses Apple’s technologies (SwiftData and CloudKit), the Developer:

- Does not guarantee that data will be stored, preserved, synchronized, or backed up.
- Is not responsible for any data loss, corruption, or failure to access documents.
- Data will be lost if the App is deleted or if you change devices without proper iCloud backup.
- Recommends that you keep independent backups of all important documents outside the App.

## 4. Notifications

The App may send reminder notifications about upcoming expirations; however:

- Notification delivery depends on device settings, permissions, system conditions, network connectivity, and Apple’s background processes.
- The App can schedule up to **64 local notifications** at a time. If more notifications are scheduled, the oldest ones will be cancelled automatically.
- The Developer does not guarantee delivery of notifications or reminders.
- The Developer is not responsible for missed notifications, expired warranties/insurances, or any associated damages or losses.

## 5. Document Types and User Responsibilities

Users may add images or PDFs of warranties, invoices, receipts, product information, medical or car insurance documents, and similar documents.

You are solely responsible for:

- Ensuring the accuracy and legality of any documents you upload.
- Complying with laws relating to personal documents.
- Avoiding uploading unlawful, copyrighted, or harmful content.

The Developer does not review, access, or verify your stored content.

## 6. In-App Purchases

The App offers optional In-App Purchases (IAPs) to support the Developer:

- **Small Tip**, **Medium Tip**, and **Large Tip**.
- All IAPs are **optional**. They do not unlock features beyond what is explicitly described.
- Purchases are processed through **Apple’s App Store payment system**, and all transactions are subject to Apple’s terms.
- All sales are **final**; refunds are only handled through Apple as per their refund policies.
- Prices may vary by region and are set by Apple. Taxes or other fees may apply.

## 7. No Professional Advice

The App does not provide legal, financial, medical, or insurance advice. Any information shown is purely informational. Users should independently verify all important deadlines and data.

## 8. Intellectual Property

The App uses Apple SFSymbols and the Inter typeface in accordance with their licenses. All other trademarks or intellectual property belong to their respective owners. The App’s UI, logic, and code belong to the Developer.

## 9. Acceptable Use

You agree not to misuse the App, reverse-engineer it, upload harmful content, or use it for commercial document management.

## 10. Limitation of Liability

To the maximum extent permitted by law, the App is provided “as is” and “as available.” The Developer makes no warranties and is not liable for data loss, missed notifications, expired warranties, financial losses, or inaccuracies. Your use of the App is entirely at your own risk.

## 11. Changes to the Terms

The Developer may update these Terms at any time. Continued use of the App constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

## 12. Governing Law

These Terms are governed by the laws of your country of residence within the European Union.
