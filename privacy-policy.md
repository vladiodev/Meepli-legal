# Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** 23 November 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your data. The App is developed by an individual developer (“the Developer”).

The App is designed with privacy first:

- No personal data is collected by the Developer.
- No accounts or analytics are used.
- Your documents remain fully private on your device and/or in your personal iCloud.
- Payments made via In-App Purchases (IAPs) are processed exclusively through Apple. The Developer does not access your payment information.

## 1. Personal Data Collected

The Developer does not collect, store, transmit, or access any personal data. All data you add is stored locally (via SwiftData) and/or in your private iCloud container (via CloudKit). Payment information for IAPs is handled by Apple and is not accessible to the Developer.

## 2. Types of Data You Store in the App

You may choose to store product information, warranty documents, insurance documents, invoices, receipts, expiration dates, photos, PDFs, spending amounts, and statistics. This data remains entirely private and accessible only to you.

## 3. iCloud / CloudKit

If you enable iCloud syncing, your data is stored in your personal iCloud storage. Apple acts as a data processor under GDPR. The Developer does not have access to your iCloud content. iCloud usage is subject to Apple’s Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

## 4. No Third-Party Analytics or Tracking

The App does not use analytics, advertising SDKs, tracking technologies, cookies, or third-party servers. The Developer receives no data about how you use the App.

## 5. Notifications

If you enable notifications, the App schedules expiration reminders locally on your device. The Developer does not receive any information about notification usage.

## 6. Data Retention

All data is stored only as long as it exists on your device or in iCloud. Deleting the App may delete local data unless backed up through iCloud or device backups.

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App does not intentionally collect data from children. Since the Developer collects no data, the App complies with children's privacy regulations.

## 8. Your Rights (GDPR)

Because the Developer collects no personal data, GDPR rights such as access, deletion, portability, and objection apply only to the data you store locally or in iCloud. You may modify or delete this data yourself at any time.

## 9. Security

Your data is protected by iOS security features, encrypted file systems, and iCloud security measures. The Developer does not process or transmit your documents.

## 10. In-App Purchases

The App offers optional In-App Purchases (IAPs) such as tips to support the Developer. Payment is handled exclusively via Apple’s payment system. The Developer does not have access to your payment information. All transactions are subject to Apple’s terms and policies.

## 11. Changes to This Policy

The Developer may update this Privacy Policy. You will be notified in the App if changes are made.

## 12. Contact

If you have questions, you may contact the Developer at: **my email**
